# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive React Progressive Web Application (PWA) showcase that demonstrates various device capabilities and modern web APIs. The application will serve as both a functional demo and a learning resource, showcasing how web applications can access native device features. The application will be deployed to GitHub Pages for easy access and demonstration purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or stakeholder, I want to see a working React PWA deployed on GitHub Pages, so that I can quickly access and demonstrate the application's capabilities without local setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed via GitHub Pages URL THEN the system SHALL load a functional React PWA
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a welcome page with navigation to different device capability demos
3. WHEN the application is accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL be responsive and provide an app-like experience
4. WHEN the user visits the site THEN the system SHALL prompt for PWA installation if supported by the browser

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test camera functionality, so that I can see how web applications can access device cameras for photo capture and video recording.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the camera demo THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions
2. WHEN camera permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL display a live camera preview
3. WHEN the user clicks the capture button THEN the system SHALL take a photo and display it
4. WHEN the user clicks the video record button THEN the system SHALL start recording video
5. IF camera permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test microphone functionality, so that I can see how web applications can record and process audio input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the microphone demo THEN the system SHALL request microphone permissions
2. WHEN microphone permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL display audio level indicators
3. WHEN the user clicks record THEN the system SHALL start audio recording
4. WHEN the user stops recording THEN the system SHALL allow playback of the recorded audio
5. IF microphone permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test file system access, so that I can see how web applications can interact with local files and directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the file explorer demo THEN the system SHALL provide file selection options
2. WHEN the user selects files THEN the system SHALL display file information (name, size, type)
3. WHEN the user uploads files THEN the system SHALL process and display file contents where appropriate
4. WHEN the user clicks download THEN the system SHALL generate and download a sample file
5. IF file access is not supported THEN the system SHALL display browser compatibility information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test motion sensors, so that I can see how web applications can access device accelerometer and gyroscope data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the accelerometer demo THEN the system SHALL request motion sensor permissions
2. WHEN permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL display real-time accelerometer data
3. WHEN the device is moved THEN the system SHALL update the displayed motion values
4. WHEN the user shakes the device THEN the system SHALL detect and respond to shake gestures
5. IF motion sensors are not available THEN the system SHALL display appropriate fallback content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test location services, so that I can see how web applications can access GPS and location data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the location demo THEN the system SHALL request location permissions
2. WHEN location permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL display current coordinates
3. WHEN location data is available THEN the system SHALL show the location on a map
4. WHEN the user requests location updates THEN the system SHALL track position changes
5. IF location services are denied or unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see additional PWA features demonstrated, so that I can understand the full capabilities of progressive web applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL work offline with cached content
2. WHEN the user installs the PWA THEN the system SHALL provide a native app-like experience
3. WHEN the application is updated THEN the system SHALL notify users of new versions
4. WHEN the user receives notifications THEN the system SHALL display push notifications if permissions are granted
5. WHEN the application is used THEN the system SHALL demonstrate service worker functionality

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test real-time communication features, so that I can see how web applications can implement WebSocket connections and real-time data exchange.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the real-time demo THEN the system SHALL establish a Socket.IO connection
2. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL display connection status and user count
3. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL broadcast it to all connected users
4. WHEN other users send messages THEN the system SHALL display them in real-time
5. WHEN the user shares location or sensor data THEN the system SHALL update other users' views in real-time
6. IF the connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection and display appropriate status

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the implementation approach for each feature, so that I can understand how to implement similar functionality in my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views any demo THEN the system SHALL provide code examples or implementation hints
2. WHEN the user navigates between demos THEN the system SHALL maintain a consistent and intuitive interface
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery suggestions
4. WHEN features are not supported THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade and inform the user
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL provide information about browser compatibility for each feature
